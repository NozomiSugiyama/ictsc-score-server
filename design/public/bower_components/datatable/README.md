Datatable v1.0.6
================

Datatable is a jQuery plugin for dynamic datatables with pagination, filtering and ajax loading.

<i>**Warning:** This is an old version of the plugin using jQuery, if you are looking for a standalone version (much faster!), check out the <a href="https://github.com/Holt59/datatable/tree/master">master</a> branch.</i>

How to use?
===========

Datatable is quite simple to use. Just add the CSS and Js file to your page (do not forget jquery):

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery.min.js"></script> 
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/datatable.min.js"></script>
```

And run:

```javascript
$('#MyTable').datatable() ;
```

**Note:** If you are using bootstrap, use `datatable-boostrap.css` instead of `datatable.css`.

The full plugin documentation is available here: http://holt59.github.io/datatable

**Warning:** If you use bootstrap 3, you need to manually set the <code>pagingListClass</code> and <code>pagingDivClass</code> options to match bootstrap 3 pagination classes.
